			<h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>

We are always aware of our physical health and look at our bodies and take care of them. 
We work out, we put cream on our skin to keep it healthy and young. However, do we ever think of our mental health, the organ that defines who we are and makes sure that we are always in check? Just because we cannot see our brain or feel a pain in it, it doesn’t mean that our brain doesn’t need care. 
I never thought that the brain is something that I should even worry about. I had the impression that I can handle as much stress, without giving my brain a break, also without getting enough sleep. Until I reached a situation where I found myself trapped in depression and my lack of awareness and knowledge in mental health. Prolonged my illness and the start of the treatment which made it even harder to recover. 
Two years ago I have suffered from a clinical depression. Had it not been for my family it would have led to suicide. Thankfully, I was aware of my depression after 6 months of me being in it and that is when the treatment and self-care had started. Here, I I decided to start a movement, Paint Therapy Ottawa, as a way to raise awareness about mental illness and the importance of art in helping cope. Where we would be present at public areas like Parliament Hill and Universities to hand out Paint, Paintbrushes, and boards for people to paint, along with that we collaborate with mental health organizations to help us raise awareness and educate people about mental illness. 
There Are different types of mental Disorders, Anxiety Disorder, Attention Deficit/hyperactivity disorder, eating disorder, intentional self-harm, mood disorder, psychosis and schizophrenia, substance abuse and lastly suicide. 
Here are some quick facts and statistics:
Between 15% and 25% of Canadians experience at least one mental health problem or illness before they turn 19, and these individuals have a higher likelihood than others of facing a second one later in their lifetime. Also, Anxiety disorders affect 5% of Canadian youth and young adult. 
Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder: ADHD affects one in 20 children worldwide. 

Eating disorders: In 2012, an estimated 1.1% of young women aged 15 to 24 years in Canada reported that they had been diagnosed with an eating disorder 

Intentional self-harm (other than suicide): begin 12 and 15 years, 17,000 hospitalizations among Canadians aged 15 and older; the highest incidence was among adolescent girls (aged 15 to 19 years).	 	 	 		
Psychosis and schizophrenia: affect 1% of the Canadian population; the Canadian Mental Health Association describes it as “youth’s greatest disabler.” 			
32% of youth reported heavy drinking, and 27% of youth reported that they had used cannabis in the previous
Suicide: Over 3,600 Canadians die by suicide every year, Among youth and young adults, suicide is the second leading cause of death, 12 and 24 indicated that they had suicide-related thoughts at some point in their lifetime(1)

Along with other self-help methods, art has helped me a lot through my depression and I wanted to share my experience with others as well. Through My journey, I have met Art Therapy which was a huge eye opener with the benefits it has for mental health.
“Art therapy is used with children, adolescents, adults, older adults, groups, families, veterans, and people with chronic health issues to assess and treat the following: anxiety, depression, and other mental and emotional problems; substance abuse and addictions; family and relationship issues; abuse and domestic violence; social and emotional difficulties related to disability and illness; trauma and loss; physical, cognitive, and neurological problems; and psychosocial difficulties related to medical illness.” 2. (American Art Therapy Association, 2012, Online) (2).
Art therapy has been used with individuals, groups, and families as a primary or adjunctive therapy to address various issues including low self-esteem (Green, Wehling, & Talsky, 1987), physical and sexual trauma (Brooke, 1995), sexual abuse (Pifalo, 2002), depression (Ponteri, 2001), anxiety (Chambala, 2008), eating disorders (Rehavia-Hanauer, 2003), and grief (Schut, de Keijser, van den Bout,& Stroebe, 1996) (3). In a study evaluating the potential benefit of weekly group art therapy, It appeared that working with art materials in the group format over time increased the patient’s sense of mastery and provided them with evidence of progress in both art media and individual goals in addition to improved depressive symptoms.(3) Other research, have showed effects of art therapy on improving personality disorders(4). Our NGO sheds the light the importance of mental health care and de-stigmatizes the notion of mental illness helping more people share their stories and experiences among the public. The workshops brings the community together and gives them a sense of relief while painting, more over we make sure that each and everyone is being educated on mental health and learn about the resources they have around them in the city.
